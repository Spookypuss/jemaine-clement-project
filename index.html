                            <p>
                                The improv-born comedy stylings and heart-warming film-making of Jemaine Clement make him my favourite actor, musician, comedian, and film-maker.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not only a Grammy award winner, Clement's success has had multiple wins and nominations for his films and television series around the world.  The 
                                breadth of his work illustrates the flexibility of his talents, and he can be seen in anything from prime-time comedy shows, to award-winning children's 
                                TV, through to cult horror classics.

                    <h4>What we do in the Shadows</h4>
                    <p>Shadows is a cult vampire mockumentory, straight out of Wellington, New Zealand.  Notoriously cut down from hundreds of hours of improv, 
                        this film also spawned hit spin-off TV series What We Do In The Shadows, and Wellington Paranormal.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Release</strong></p>
                    <p>19 June, 2014</p>
                    <p><strong>What I like about it</strong></p>
                    <p>The creators are improv comedy legends, and the theme of the mundane comedy of a group of vampires living together for centuries, but still
                        arguing whose turn it is to do the dishes just tickles my funny bone.

                    <h4>Flight of the Conchords</h4>
                    <p><strong>Release</strong></p>
                    <p>25 September, 2007</p>
                    <p><strong>What I like about it</strong></p>
                    <p>Conchords is the kind of off-beat comedy that - if you're into it - will keep you laughing for years.  Skillfully weaving together music and comedy to 
                        chart the progress of two Kiwi immigrants to New York city, the hapless pair find themselves in low-stakes peril as well as navigating their never-ending 
                        run of dating misfortunes.  One of New Zealand's best exports of all time.

                    <h4>People, Places, Things</h4>
                    <p>This is a film about a father coming to terms with his wife leaving him, and the impact that has upon the relationship with his young daughters</p>
                    <p><strong>Release</strong></p>
                    <p>26 January, 2015</p>
                    <p><strong>What I like about it</strong></p>
                    <p>Clement gives a power-house performance as the chronically sad father, ex-husband, and teacher, with down-beat wit and more than a dash of pathos.  A perennial 
                        favourite of mine, it never fails to pull at my heart-strings and leaves me yearning for a happy ending for Clement's character, Nate.
